    <h2>My Volunteering Experience</h2>
    <p>
      Most of my volunteer work has taken place online through Telegram, where I’ve contributed to educational communities by supporting students academically and administratively.

    <h3>What I Gained</h3>
    <p>
      Volunteering taught me leadership, patience, and how to manage large communities effectively. I improved my ability to communicate clearly with students of all levels and learned how to motivate and mentor others in a digital space. Being entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing thousands of students across multiple groups was an incredible honor and strengthened my passion for education and service.
