    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <p>
      Teaching has significantly sharpened my communication skills and deepened my understanding of the material I was teaching. I learned how to break down complex topics into manageable parts, adapt my approach based on student feedback, and build a supportive learning environment. Watching students grow in confidence and competence was incredibly rewarding and reinforced my passion for education and mentorship.
